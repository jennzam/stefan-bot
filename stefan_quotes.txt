For over a century, I've lived in secret. Hiding in the shadows, alone in the world. Until now. I'm a vampire and this is my story.
Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
Yes, being a 150 year old teenager has been the height of my happiness.
I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Don't ever threaten me again.
I knew that you would trust me, if you believed I was worthy of your trust.
You were adopted, Elena.
If you're here for revenge, this is going to end very badly for you.
What you did today... coming to help me... you could have been killed.
You didn't do anything. You were saving my life. And I'm saving yours.
Actually, I just have no sense of Damon Humor.
I'm sorry, your tone implies that I'm actually supposed to care.
I'm not sad, I'm freaking hungry!
Goodbye, brother.
Damon.
I'm on my way to murder elena.
I'M FREAKING HUNGRY!
