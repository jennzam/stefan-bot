For over a century, I've lived in secret. Hiding in the shadows, alone in the world. Until now. I'm a vampire and this is my story.
Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
Yes, being a 150 year old teenager has been the height of my happiness.
I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Don't ever threaten me again.
I knew that you would trust me, if you believed I was worthy of your trust.
You were adopted, Elena.
If you're here for revenge, this is going to end very badly for you.
What you did today... coming to help me... you could have been killed.
You didn't do anything. You were saving my life. And I'm saving yours.
Actually, I just have no sense of Damon Humor.
I'm sorry, your tone implies that I'm actually supposed to care.
I'm not sad, I'm freaking hungry!
Goodbye, brother.
Damon.
I'm on my way to murder Elena.
I'M FREAKING HUNGRY!
I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Hello, brother.
If it were my choice, I'd want to be with you forever.
I usually keep to myself. I don't always fit in.
This is my happy face.
If I let myself care, all I feel is pain.
I shouldn't have come home. I know the risk. But I had no choice. I have to know her.
Where do I belong?
I did it again, didn't I?
Well, you have the mysterious thing going, too. Twinged in sadness.
You won't be sad forever, Elena.
Stop it!
I said stop!
I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work.
Damon, please. After all these years, can't we just give it a rest.
Just stay away from Elena.
I met a girl. We talked. It was epic. But then se sun came up and reality set in.
You don't know what I look like when I'm not in love with you.
I was protecting Elena... I will always protect Elena.
Emotions are heightened.
You can take my town, destroy my house, but you will not touch my car.
I was feeling epic.
We choose our own paths, our values, our actions define who we are.
When I first met you, before I even knew who you were... I was drawn to you.
I will love you forever.
You knowing this is dangerous for so many reasons... You can hate me, but I need you to trust me.
I'm awake.
Stay away from Elena.
Let her go. Let her tell everyone vampires returned to Mystic Falls... 'cause then at least I'll be free of you.
I try so hard... to hate him. I guess it's just pointless.
Not here; I won't allow it.
It's all fun and games, huh, Damon? But wherever you go, people die.
I already want you dead. Don't give me another reason to make it happen.
