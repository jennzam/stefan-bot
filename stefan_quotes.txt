For over a century, I've lived in secret. Hiding in the shadows, alone in the world. Until now. I'm a vampire and this is my story.
Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
Yes, being a 150 year old teenager has been the height of my happiness.
I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Don't ever threaten me again.
I knew that you would trust me, if you believed I was worthy of your trust.
You were adopted, Elena.
If you're here for revenge, this is going to end very badly for you.
What you did today... coming to help me... you could have been killed.
You didn't do anything. You were saving my life. And I'm saving yours.
Actually, I just have no sense of Damon Humor.
I'm sorry, your tone implies that I'm actually supposed to care.
I'm not sad, I'm freaking hungry!
Goodbye, brother.
Damon.
I'm on my way to murder Elena.
I'M FREAKING HUNGRY!
I would never hurt you. You're safe with me.
Hello, brother.
If it were my choice, I'd want to be with you forever.
I usually keep to myself. I don't always fit in.
This is my happy face.
If I let myself care, all I feel is pain.
I shouldn't have come home. I know the risk. But I had no choice. I have to know her.
Where do I belong?
I did it again, didn't I?
Well, you have the mysterious thing going, too. Twinged in sadness.
You won't be sad forever, Elena.
Stop it!
I said stop!
I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work.
Damon, please. After all these years, can't we just give it a rest.
Just stay away from Elena.
I met a girl. We talked. It was epic. But then se sun came up and reality set in.
You don't know what I look like when I'm not in love with you.
I was protecting Elena... I will always protect Elena.
